# Critical Thinking Week 1

# Part 1: Write a Python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers.
    #Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, add them together to find the output. 
    #Also, subtract the two numbers to find the output.

# Step 1: user input two numbers (num1 and num2)
num1 = int(input('Enter First Number: '))
num2 = int(input('Enter Second Number: '))

# Step 2: calculate sum and display
print('Sum of both numbers =', num1+num2)

# Step 3: calculate difference and display
print('Difference of both numbers =', num1-num2)

# Part 2: Write a Python program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers.
    #Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, multiply them together to find the output. 
    #Also, divide num1/num2 to find the output.

# Step 1: user input two numbers (num1 and num2)
num1 = int(input('Enter First Number: '))
num2 = int(input('Enter Second Number: '))

# Step 2: calculate product and display
print('Product of both numbers =', num1*num2)

# Step 3: calculate quotient and display
print('Quotient of both numbers =', num1/num2)
